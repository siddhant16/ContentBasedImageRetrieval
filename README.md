The project will help improve the user experience of shopping t-shirts on
e-commerce websites. Initially the customer had to search the product using
text . It is quite difficult for the customers to express an image which has a
very abstract or irregular pattern into a text based query. In this situation,
an image is the best way to express what the customer needs.

The project uses image recognition which will give the users the option of
search by image. It involves a user giving a t-shirts image as an input .The
algorithm will perform an object or sub-image recogniton, pattern based
recognition , color based, text based and texture based recognition to re-
trieve the set of matching images. A feature based extraction will be used
for the purpose of subimage recognition. A distributed database of images
would be maintained in order to store a variety of t-shirt images on which
the algorithm will be applied.

Our project not only apply the existing techniques also but aims to iden-
tify areas of improvement which could be time complexity, accuracy and
space complexity
